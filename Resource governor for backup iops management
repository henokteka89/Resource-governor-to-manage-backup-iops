Step 1: Create a Resource Pool

-- A Resource Pool defines the maximum CPU and I/O resources that can be used by a workload group.

-- Create a Resource Pool with specific I/O limits
CREATE RESOURCE POOL BackupPool
WITH
(
   MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = 2000,  -- Set this according to your needs
   MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = 100,   -- Ensure a minimum level of I/O for other operations
   MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = 20,     -- Set the maximum memory usage
   CAP_CPU_PERCENT = 10         -- Set the maximum CPU usage (optional if CPU is not the bottleneck)
);
GO
Step 2: Create a Workload Group

A Workload Group is where you define how queries using the Resource Pool will be managed.

-- Create a Workload Group within the BackupPool 
CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP BackupGroup USING BackupPool;
GO

Step 3: Create a Classifier Function

The Classifier Function is a user-defined function that directs specific sessions to the appropriate Workload Group based on certain criteria. You'll define the function to route backup operations to the 'BackupGroup'.
--this function didnt work because it can't bind DMVs
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.BackupClassifier() RETURNS SYSNAME
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @WorkloadGroup SYSNAME;

    -- Check if the session is running a backup operation
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
        CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
        WHERE r.session_id = @@SPID
          AND t.text LIKE 'BACKUP DATABASE%'
          AND (
                t.text LIKE '%YourDatabaseName1%'
                OR t.text LIKE '%YourDatabaseName2%'
                OR t.text LIKE '%YourDatabaseName3%'
              )
    )
    BEGIN
        SET @WorkloadGroup = 'BackupGroup';
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        SET @WorkloadGroup = 'default'; -- Default workload group
    END

    RETURN @WorkloadGroup;
END;
GO

Step 4: Enable the Classifier Function in Resource Governor

Assign the classifier function to Resource Governor.

-- Enable Resource Governor and assign the classifier function
ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR WITH (CLASSIFIER_FUNCTION = dbo.BackupClassifier);
GO

-- Apply the Resource Governor configuration
ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;
GO

Step 5: Test the Configuration

To ensure that the Resource Governor is working as expected, you can run a full backup on one of the specified databases and monitor the Resource Governor statistics.

-- Perform a full backup on one of the databases
BACKUP DATABASE YourDatabaseName1 TO DISK = 'YourBackupPath\YourDatabaseName1.bak';
GO

-- Check which workload group is being used
--- Show the logins
use master;
go

Select 
s.session_id
,s.login_name
,g.name
from sys.dm_exec_sessions as s
join sys.dm_resource_governor_workload_groups as g
on s.group_id = g.group_id
where s.session_id > 60

 

Additional Considerations:

• Adjust the Resource Pool parameters as necessary based on the specific needs of your environment.

• Monitor the Impact of these settings, as resource limits might need to be adjusted based on actual performance.

• Backups Outside of Resource Governor: If needed, other backups (e.g., log backups) not tied to this pool can be routed through a different or default pool.



Determining the IOPS Limit

Given that throughput is often the limiting factor, you need to balance your IOPS setting to match the throughput without exceeding the disk’s capabilities. Here’s a simple calculation approach:

• Baseline Calculation: Throughput is the product of IOPS and the size of each I/O operation. If you're dealing with typical I/O sizes (e.g., 64 KB):

• Throughput=IOPS×I/O Size\text{Throughput} = \text{IOPS} \times \text{I/O Size}Throughput=IOPS×I/O Size

• IOPS=ThroughputI/O Size\text{IOPS} = \frac{\text{Throughput}}{\text{I/O Size}}IOPS=I/O SizeThroughput​

• For 500 MBps throughput and 64 KB I/O size:

• IOPS=500×102464=8,000 IOPS\text{IOPS} = \frac{500 \times 1024}{64} = 8,000 \text{ IOPS}IOPS=64500×1024​=8,000 IOPS

Adjust for Disk Limits:

• Since the maximum IOPS for a P50 disk is 7,500, you should not set a limit higher than this.

• Set the Resource Governor IOPS limit slightly below the maximum to ensure other processes can still use the disk.

• Ideal IOPS setting for Resource Governor: 6,000 to 7,000 IOPS.

Applying the IOPS Limit in Resource Governor
-- Create or alter the resource pool with an IOPS limit
ALTER RESOURCE POOL BackupPool
WITH
(
   MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = 6500, -- Set just below the maximum limit
   MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = 500   -- Ensure a minimum level of I/O for other operations
);
GO

-- Apply the Resource Governor configuration
ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;
GO
